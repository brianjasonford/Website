## Hello!
This is the Github repository for my personal website. The website is very basic and made with Eleventy. I've been documenting what I'm doing to make the website [here](https://brianjasonford.com/howto/). 

Currently, I am not using Github for anything other that backup. My thought is that if I break anything, this will let me rewind. But, I've made the repository public in case that is hepful to anybody.
