Hello again!

This is my first blog post on my new website. I did not have my old website for very long, so you probably did not see it. If you did see it, you might be thinking that this new website looks just like the old one that I made by following [HTML for People](https://htmlforpeople.com). That is correct and purposeful. But, behind the scenes, things are _quite_ different. I rebuilt from the ground up using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev), which is a static site generator. I want to write about the experience of using Eleventy as a non-programmer with no training and limited experience. I also want to write about why I did this in the first place. But, for now, what I want most is to get this website up online. 

If you are reading this, I did that!

More to come.
