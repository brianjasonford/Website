I play a character in D&D who, on occasion, says outlandish things. As an offhand remark, that character once asked a fellow adventurer, “ever party with an octopus?” That remark must have garnered my DM’s attention. She sent me [The Soul of an Octopus: A Surprising Exploration into the Wonder of Consciousness]( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22609485-the-soul-of-an-octopu) by Sy Montgomery as a Hanukkah gift. I finished this book yesterday, making it the first book I’ve read in 2026.

This New York Times bestseller and National Book Award finalist gets mixed reviews. In some ways, I found this nonfiction book less insightful than Ray Nayler’s outstanding work of science fiction, [The Mountain in the Sea]( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59808603-the-mountain-in-the-sea). The Soul of an Octopus presents a heartfelt chronical of the author’s encounters with, and emotional attachments to, octopuses. Some parts were genuinely moving while others were a touch saccharine for my taste. 

On the whole, the read was pleasant and the book itself is a lovely token from an observant and caring friend.
