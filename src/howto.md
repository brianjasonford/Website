## How I Made this Website
**I am not qualified to teach you how to make a website.** I am not a programmer or developer or anything like that. If you are making your first website, [HTML For People](https://htmlforpeople.com/) by Blake Watson is the best place to start. After working through HTML for People, I found [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). I'm using Eleventiy to generate this website. Before using Eleventy, I strongly recommend Zach Leatherman's great video [6 Minutes to Build a Blog from Scratch with Eleventy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzf9A9tkkl4) and Stephanie Eckles' fantastic class, [Builld an Eleventy (11ty) Site from Scratch](https://egghead.io/courses/build-an-eleventy-11ty-site-from-scratch-bfd3). Stephanie's website, [11ty Rocks!](https://11ty.rocks/), well, rocks! The [Learn Eleventy](https://learn-eleventy.pages.dev/) project is outstanding, even if their scope is quite a bit broader than what I needed. [11tybundle.dev](https://11tybundle.dev/) shares the latest and greatest. Finally, but importantly, the folks at the [11ty Discord server](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/discord/) have been welcoming, kind, and helpful - sometimes going out of their way to help me. I appreciate them very much.

This is what I did...
